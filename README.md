<h1>SpaceGame</h1>
SpaceGame is an exciting mobile game where the player controls a UFO spaceship, dodging space rocks while navigating through the vastness of space. The goal is to move forward, avoid obstacles, and rack up the highest score. As the spaceship advances, the speed increases, making the game more challenging. The game ends when the spaceship collides with a rock, and the high score is maintained to track the player’s best performance.
